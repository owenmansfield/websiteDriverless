      <p>Self driving cars have the potential to revolutionize our world as we know it. From reducing time wasted in bumpter-to-bumper traffic, to reducing time spent driving entirely, the way people all over the world structure their commute could fundamentally change. What would you do with an extra 40 minutes each morning and evening before and after work? Read the news? Get an extra 40 minutes of sleep? Shorten your workday?
      </p>

      <p>Removal of humans from the operation of vehicles could yield huge gains in safety (94% of vehicle crashes involve human error), efficiency (communicating vehicles can more cohesively interact that un-communicative humans), and help easy traffic congestion and the resultant pollution. However, as nice as these luxuries sound, tricky ethical questions necessarily come along with giving up control of a two-ton metal sledgehammer on wheels. What happens when accidents do still happen?

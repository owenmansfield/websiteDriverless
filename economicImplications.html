      <p>In the U.S. alone, we spent 29.6 billion hours commuting in 2014. With that amount of time, ancient Egyptians could have built 26 pyramids of Giza. This is clearly a monumental waste of time, energy, and human potential. It is also estimated that up to 30% of urban traffic is generated by drivers looking for parking. How are humans supposed to know if there will be a space up ahead, or right around the corner? They can't, but this is one problem, of many, that could be solved by self-driving, intelligent cars. All told, the economic benefits just derived from time saved are mind-boggling. Not to mention, reduced costs from car accidents and injuries. Unfortunately, not all outlooks are good.

      <p>As companies race to put self driving technology on the road, truck drivers may be some of the first to feel the impact. Self driving vehicles will directly undermine hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs. According to a report from Goldman Sachs Economic Research, as autonomous vehicle saturation peaks "U.S. drivers could see job losses at a rate of 25,000 a month, or 300,000 a year". In 2014, 4 million Americans were employed in driver jobs: 3.1 million as truck drivers. In the growing wave of automation replacing traditional occupations, truck drivers stand to lose greatly.

      <p>Some of the major motivations behind self driving cars are:
        <ol>
          <li> Saving time </li>
          <li> Reducing crashes </li>
          <li> Increasing accessibility (to blind or low-vision people) </li>
          <li> Increasing convenience </li>
          <li> Decreasing environmental damage from transportaiton </li>
      </p>

      <p>The sci-fi dream of self-driving vehicles has been around since vehicles themselves have existed. But, the real development of companies and products making this dream a reality is much more recent. Waymo was founded in 2009 as the Google Self-Driving Car Project and ushered in the newest and most fruitful wave of advancements in autonomous vehicles. It took until 2017 for Waymo to start testing driverless cars without a safety driver in the vehicle ready to take over if needed.
      </p>

      <p> In 2012, six US states had introduced legislation related to self-driving vehicles. As of 2017, 33 states had, with 41 states and D.C. having considered legislation. As more and more people began to realize autonomous vehicles have a place in the future of the automotive and transportation sectors, every municipality with cars will have to consider how to best adapt their laws to serve their citizens.
